This project, "HTML Recipe Book," involved learning essential HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, images, and lists to organize content. I used attributes like those for image sources and link references, and learned nesting HTML elements. The project also introduced me to the basics of Git workflow, including commands for adding, committing, and pushing changes.
