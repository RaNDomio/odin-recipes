    <h1>Easy blini</h1>
    <img src="../images/Blini.jpg" alt="Image of blini">
    <p>This blini recipe makes bite-sized pancakes that result in perfect appetizers. Top blini with smoked salmon, creme fraiche, or even caviar. Add a sprig of dill and they are sure to impress. My children also love eating these plain too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>       
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>    
        <li>1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, egg, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a separate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture until the batter is fully combined.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. 
            Cooking several blini at a time, drop batter, one tablespoon at a time, onto the heated skillet. 
            Cook until bubbles form, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until brown, about 1 minute more. 
            Move to a paper towel-lined plate to help soak up excess butter.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
